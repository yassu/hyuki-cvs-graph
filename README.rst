Hyuki-CVS-Graph
===============

Usage
=====

.. code:: bash

    hyuki-graph [option] [base_dir]

where, ``base_dir``\ is a the most top directory which is watched by this program.

Note that default ``base_dir``\ is ``.``\ .


This is a tool like as  `taking-star-table with color <https://note.mu/hyuki/n/n9a6e7c1e0d7b>`__ (ja),
which considered by Mr. Hyuki.

This tool makes table which is written project-name, day number from today and commit-status.

Also, if there is ``hyuki_graph.json`` or ``hyuki_graph.yaml`` file in directory, which this program watch, this program make
a table by using commits number which got by CVS and content of the file.

Furtheremore, if cross point which project-name and day number is written D by red color,
this means that the project does not committed.

If it is written M by yellow color, this means that the project is committed some times less than 10.

If it is written L by green color, this means that the project is committed some times more than or equal to 10.


Syntax of Input File
======================

This program receives following syntax files.

As json syntax:

.. code::

  {
    project name: {
      date: commit number,
      date: commit number,
      e.t.c.
    },
    project name: {
      date: commit number,
      date: commit number,
      e.t.c.
    }
    e.t.c.
  }

where, date is a string which has form like "2000/01/01" or "2000-01-01".

As yaml syntax, like json syntax:

.. code::

  project name:
    date: commit number
    date: commit number
    e.t.c.
  project name:
    date: commit number
    date: commit number
    e.t.c.

If you want to use yaml syntax, import PyYaml package in manually:

.. code::

    pip install PyYaml

   Default value is 10.
-  ``--DA``, ``--dead_or_alive``: Showing D and A instead of showing D, M and L.  If there is no commit, D is printted. And there is it, A is printted.
